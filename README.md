  For the first model, utilizing the naive random oversampling algorithms, those considered high-risk had a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.66, while the low-risk group had a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.64. The first model had a balanced accuracy score of 0.638. For the second model, utilizing the SMOTE oversampling algorithms, those considered high-risk had a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.66, while the low-risk group had a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.68. The second model had a balanced accuracy score of 0.668. For the third model, utilizing the cluster centroids undersampling algorithm, those considered high-risk had a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.62, while the low-risk group had a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.40. The third model had a balanced accuracy score of 0.668. For the last model, utilizing the SMOTEENN over and under sampling algorithm, those considered high-risk had a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.72, while the low-risk group had a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.55. The last model had a balanced accuracy score of 0.512.

  Based on precision, recall, and balanced accuracy scores, I recommend using the second model, which employed the SMOTE oversampling algorithms. Although all models had the same precision, and models 2 and 3 had the same balanced accuracy scores, model 2 had the greatest recall for the high-risk and low-risk groups.
